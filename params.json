{"name":"Timeline","tagline":"Timeline chronicles history and events in a clean beautiful way ","body":"# Timeline\r\nTimeline is an easy way to showcase events. [See it here](http://joeylea.com/timeline/).  Timeline's features include autoplay, early preview, and custom timers. It uses no external JavaScript dependencies and works on IE11 and all other major browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nGetting started is easy. Timeline requires that you include a script and stylesheet, and that you use specific ids and classes in your markup.  Follow the instructions below to get started.\r\n\r\n#### First, include the Timeline stylesheet and script into your HTML\r\n    <html>\r\n     <head>\r\n      <link href=\"/styles/timeline.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n     </head>\r\n     <body>\r\n      <!-- Add your Timeline markup here -->\r\n      <script src=\"/js/timeline.min.js\"></script>\r\n     </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\n#### Next, use the Timeline markup to create your line, ball and events\r\n    <div id=\"tL-body\" class=\"dark-theme round-theme\">\r\n      <div id=\"tL\">\r\n        <div class=\"tL line\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"tL ball\"></div> <!-- add id=tL-autoplay to this element (optional) -->\r\n\r\n        <!-- Add your events -->\r\n        <div class=\"tL event\" data-side=\"right\" data-timer=\"8000\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"tL title\">My first event</h4>\r\n          <time class=\"tL date\">Today</time>\r\n          <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n           <h3>This is timeline!</h3>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"tL event\" data-side=\"left\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"tL title\">Second  event</h4>\r\n          <time class=\"tL date\">March 11, 2016</time>\r\n          <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n            <p>You should check out the autoplay in the docs, wow...</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Autoplay\r\nAutoplay automatically cycles through each event on your timeline.  By default, it spends 12 seconds on each event, but you can modify this by using a custom timer (see below). Any mouse click will disable autoplay, but if restarted, it begins where it left off.\r\n\r\nEnable autoplay by adding an element with the id of `tL-autoplay` to your page.  How you choose to style this element is up to you, but the id `tL-autoPlay` must be used to trigger the feature. Here is a simple Bootstrap example that works nicely with the built in Timeline stylesheet.\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"tL ball\" id=\"tL-autoPlay\">\r\n      <div id=\"tL-autoPlay-icon\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n#### Custom Timer\r\nYou can change the amount of time that Autoplay will pause on a particular event by adding the `data-timer` attribute to any .tL.event element.  Choose your speed in milliseconds, but do not include the unit type: i.e. data-timer=5000. By default Autoplay pauses for 12000ms.\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"tL event\" data-timer=\"20000\" data-side=\"right\">\r\n      ...\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Early Preview\r\nEarly preview makes an event on the Timeline visible before it's clicked.  Add the `early-open` class to any .tL.event element to enable Early Preview. To hide specific body content from showing up, use a `not-early` class on the element. \r\n\r\n    <div class=\"tL event early-open\" data-side=\"right\">\r\n      ...\r\n      <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n        <p>This content will display on the timeline.</p>\r\n        <p class=\"not-early\">This content will not show up with the early preview and will only display when the event is clicked.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

{"name":"Timeline","tagline":"Timeline chronicles history and events in a clean beautiful way ","body":"### Timeline\r\nTimeline is an easy and beautiful way to chronicle history.  It has many features including autoplay, early preview, custom timers, and event read indicators. It has no dependencies but works best when used with a responsive grid-layout framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nGetting started is easy. First include the timeline stylesheets and javascript.  Timeline requires that you use specific ids and classes in order for it to work.  Follow the basic timeline example below.\r\n\r\n#### First, include stylesheets and script into your HTML\r\n    <head>\r\n      <link href=\"/styles/timeline.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n      <!-- Add your Timeline and events -->\r\n      <script src=\"/js/timeline.min.js\"></script>\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\n#### Next, add the Timeline markup and your events\r\n    <div id=\"tL-body\" class=\"dark-theme round-theme\"> <!-- both classes and the id are necessary -->\r\n      <div id=\"tL\">\r\n        <div class=\"tL line\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"tL ball\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"tL event\" data-side=\"right\" data-timer=\"8000\">\r\n          <h4 class=\"tL title\">My first event</h4>\r\n          <time class=\"tL date\">Today</time>\r\n          <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n           This is timeline!\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"col-lg-12 text-center dark-theme round-theme\" id=\"tL-body\">\r\n                            <h1>Timeline</h1>\r\n                            <p class=\"lead\" style=\"color:#ddd;\">I created <em>Timeline</em> to chronicle history and events.</p>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <div id=\"tL\">\r\n                                <div class=\"tL line\"></div>\r\n                                <div class=\"tL ball\" id=\"tL-autoPlay\"><div id=\"tL-autoPlay-icon\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span></div></div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <div class=\"tL event\" data-side=\"right\" data-timer=\"8000\">\r\n                                    <h4 class=\"tL title\">Added Auto Play to <em>Timeline</em></h4>\r\n                                    <time class=\"tL date\">April 16, 2015</time>\r\n                                    <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n                                        <p>See it in action by clicking the play circle at the top of this <em>Timeline</em>.  It allows for variable speed with a <em>data-timer</em> attribute, and has a status bar to indicate when it will switch to the next event.</p>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div class=\"tL event\" data-side=\"left\" data-timer=\"10000\">\r\n                                    <h4 class=\"tL title\">Removed jQuery dependency for <em>Timeline</em></h4>\r\n                                    <time class=\"tL date\">April 16, 2015</time>\r\n                                    <div class=\"tL body\">\r\n                                        <p>The jQuery library is a bit overkill to power <em>Timeline</em>, so I removed it and coded it up as vanilla JavaScript instead.
